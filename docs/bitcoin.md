## Generating Addresses

Bitcoin addresses will be generated from the supplied `BTC_MASTER_PUBLIC_KEY`.

## Bitcoind setup

- Set `txindex=1` to [index all transactions](https://bitcore.io/guides/full-node/).

## Tips

If you will be using a wallet like Electrum to manage the funds, the master public key you find there *is not* the one you should place here. The key placed here can be derived the following manner:

```sh
ruby scripts/electrum.rb master_public_key_you_see_in_electrum
```

Of course, test that the addresses generated by this application are the same as the receiving addresses in Electrum.
